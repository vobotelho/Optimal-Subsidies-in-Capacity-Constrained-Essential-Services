Description: Bindings to 'libsodium' <https://doc.libsodium.org/>: a modern,  easy-to-use software library for encryption, decryption, signatures, password hashing and more. Sodium uses curve25519, a state-of-the-art Diffie-Hellman  function by Daniel Bernstein, which has become very popular after it was  discovered that the NSA had backdoored Dual EC DRBG.
