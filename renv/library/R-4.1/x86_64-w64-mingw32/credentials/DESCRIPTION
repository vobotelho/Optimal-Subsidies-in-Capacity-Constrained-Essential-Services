Description: Setup and retrieve HTTPS and SSH credentials for use with 'git' and  other services. For HTTPS remotes the package interfaces the 'git-credential'  utility which 'git' uses to store HTTP usernames and passwords. For SSH  remotes we provide convenient functions to find or generate appropriate SSH  keys. The package both helps the user to setup a local git installation, and also provides a back-end for git/ssh client libraries to authenticate with  existing user credentials.
