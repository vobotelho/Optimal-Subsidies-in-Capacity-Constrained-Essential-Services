<h2>
Beadlet Anemones Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data give the spatial locations and diameters
of sea anemones (beadlet anemone
<em>Actinia equina</em>) in a sample plot 
on the north face of a boulder,
well above low tide level, at Quiberon (Bretagne, France) in May 1976.
</p>
<p>The data were originally described and discussed by Kooijman (1979a).
Kooijman (1979b) shows a hand-drawn plot of the original data.
The data are discussed  by Upton and Fingleton (1985)
as Example 1.8 on pages 64&ndash;67. 
</p>
<p>The <code>anemones</code> dataset is taken directly from Table 1.11
of Upton and Fingleton (1985). The coordinates and
diameters are integer multiples of an idiosyncratic unit of length.
The boundary is a rectangle 280 by 180 units.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(anemones)</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>anemones</code> is an object of class <code>"ppp"</code>
representing the point pattern of anemone locations.
It is a marked point pattern with numeric marks representing
anemone diameter.
See <code><a href="../../spatstat.geom/help/ppp.object.html">ppp.object</a></code> for details of the format.
</p>


<h3>Units</h3>

<p>There is some confusion about the correct physical scale for these
data. According to Upton and Fingleton (1985), one unit in the dataset 
is approximately 0.475 cm. According to Kooijman (1979a, 1979b)
and also quoted by Upton and Fingleton (1985), the
physical size of the sample plot was 14.5 by 9.75 decimetres
(145 by 97.5 centimetres). 
However if the data are plotted at this scale, they are too small for
a rectangle of this size, and the appearance of the plot
does not match the original hand-drawn plot in Kooijman (1979b).
To avoid confusion, we have not assigned a unit scale to this
dataset.
