<h2>
Murchison gold deposits
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data recording the spatial locations of gold deposits and associated
geological features in the Murchison area of Western Australia.
Extracted from a large scale (1:500,000) study of the
Murchison area by the Geological Survey of Western Australia
(Watkins and Hickman, 1990). The features recorded are
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> the locations of gold deposits;
</p>
</li>
<li><p> the locations of geological faults;
</p>
</li>
<li><p> the region that contains greenstone bedrock.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The study region is contained in a <i>330 * 400</i> kilometre
rectangle. At this scale, gold deposits are points, i.e. their spatial
extent is negligible. 
Gold deposits in this region occur only in greenstone bedrock.
Geological faults can be observed reliably only within the same
region. However, some faults have been extrapolated
(by geological &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo;) outside the greenstone boundary 
from information observed in the greenstone region.
</p>
<p>Deposit locations were extracted from the Minedex database
(Geological Survey of Western Australia, n.d.) and include deposits of
all sizes. The fault geometry and greenstone boundaries
were mapped and collated by Watkins and Hickman (1990).
</p>
<p>These data were analysed by Foxall and Baddeley (2002) and Brown et al
(2002); see also Groves et al (2000), Knox-Robinson and Groves (1997),
Baddeley, Rubak and Turner (2015) and Baddeley (2019).
The main aim is to predict the intensity of the
point pattern of gold deposits from the more easily observable fault
pattern.
