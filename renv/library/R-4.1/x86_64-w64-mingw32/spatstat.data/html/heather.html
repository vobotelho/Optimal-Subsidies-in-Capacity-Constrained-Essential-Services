<h2>Diggle's Heather Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The spatial mosaic of vegetation of the heather plant
(<em>Calluna vulgaris</em>) recorded in a 10 by 20 metre
sampling plot in Sweden.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(heather)</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with three entries, representing the same data at
different spatial resolutions:
</p>

<table summary="Rd table">
<tr>
 <td style="text-align: left;">
    <code>coarse</code> </td><td style="text-align: left;"> original heather data, 100 by 200 pixels </td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td style="text-align: left;">
    <code>medium</code> </td><td style="text-align: left;"> current  heather data, 256 by 512 pixels </td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td style="text-align: left;">
    <code>fine</code> </td><td style="text-align: left;">   finest resolution data, 778 by 1570 pixels
  </td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Each of these entries is an object of class <code>"owin"</code>
containing a binary pixel mask. All spatial coordinates are
given in metres.
</p>


<h3>Notes on data</h3>

<p>These data record the spatial mosaic of vegetation
of the heather plant (<em>Calluna vulgaris</em>) in a 10 by 20 metre
sampling plot near Jadraas, Sweden. 
They were recorded and first analysed by Diggle(1981).
</p>
<p>The dataset <code>heather</code> contains three different versions of the data
that have been analysed by different writers over the decades.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>coarse:</dt><dd>
<p>Data as originally digitised by Diggle in 1983
at 100 by 200 pixels resolution (i.e. 10 pixels = 1 metre).
</p>
<p>These data were entered by hand in the form of a
run-length encoding (original file no longer available)
and translated by a program into a 100 by 200 pixel binary image.
</p>
<p>There are known to be some errors in the image
which arise from errors in counting the run-length
so that occasionally there will be an unexpected 'spike'
on one single column.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>fine:</dt><dd>
<p>A fine scale digitisation of the original map,
prepared by CWI (Centre for Computer Science, Amsterdam,
Netherlands) in 1994.
</p>
<p>The original hand-drawn map
was scanned by Adrian Baddeley <a href="mailto:Adrian.Baddeley@curtin.edu.au">Adrian.Baddeley@curtin.edu.au</a>, and processed
by Chris Jonker, Henk Heijmans and Adrian Baddeley <a href="mailto:Adrian.Baddeley@curtin.edu.au">Adrian.Baddeley@curtin.edu.au</a>
to yield a clean binary image of 778 by 1570 pixels resolution.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>medium:</dt><dd>
<p>The version of the heather data currently supplied on
Professor Diggle's website. This is a 256 by 512 pixel image.
The method used to create this image is not stated.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>History of analysis of data</h3>

<p>The data were recorded, presented and analysed by Diggle (1983).
He proposed a Boolean model consisting of discs of random size
with centres generated by of a Poisson point process.
</p>
<p>Renshaw and Ford (1983) reported that spectral analysis of the data
suggested the presence of strong row and column effects. However, this
may have been attributable to errors in the run-length encoding
of the original data.
</p>
<p>Hall (1985) and Hall (1988, pp 301-318) took a bootstrap approach.
</p>
<p>Ripley (1988, pp. 121-122, 131-135] used opening and closing functions
to argue that a Boolean model of discs is inappropriate.
</p>
<p>Cressie (1991, pp. 763-770) tried a more general Boolean model.
